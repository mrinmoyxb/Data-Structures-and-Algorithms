**CORE C++ Concepts:**

ðŸŸ¢ Stage 1: Core C++ Proficiency (Foundation)
Goal: Build a strong grip on language features that directly affect memory and performance.

ðŸ”¹ Topics
- Pointers and References 
- Stack vs Heap
- Dynamic Memory (new, delete) 
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- const, inline, constexpr, static
- Scope and Lifetime

ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2: Memory Management & Optimization
Goal: Learn to allocate, manage, and debug memory effectively.

ðŸ”¹ Topics
- Smart Pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr)
- Memory Leaks, Dangling Pointers, Use-after-free
- Memory Alignment and Padding
- Object Size and Layout
- Custom Allocators (optional advanced)
- valgrind or AddressSanitizer usage

ðŸŸ  Stage 3: Speed and CPU-level Optimization
Goal: Minimize bottlenecks and make code CPU-efficient.

ðŸ”¹ Topics
- Loop Unrolling
- Inline functions vs Macros
- Avoiding Virtual Calls in tight loops
- Cache locality and false sharing
- SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) basics
- Profiling with gprof, perf, or google-perftools

âœ… Practice
- Use std::chrono to benchmark small functions
- Profile matrix operations or numerical algorithms

ðŸ”´ Stage 4: Concurrency & Threading (for Speed)
Goal: Unlock parallelism for faster computations.

ðŸ”¹ Topics
- std::thread, std::mutex, std::lock_guard
- Thread safety and race conditions
- Atomic operations and memory order
- Thread pools and async tasks
- OpenMP or TBB for large-scale parallelism

âœ… Practice
- Parallelize a math function like calculating variance over a large array
- Write a thread-safe logging system

ðŸ›  Tools Youâ€™ll Need
- valgrind, gprof, perf â€“ Profiling and Memory Debugging
- clang-tidy, cppcheck â€“ Static Analysis
- CMake â€“ Cross-platform builds
- pybind11 â€“ Python bindings
- Google Benchmark â€“ Micro-benchmarking
